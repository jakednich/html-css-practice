                <h1>The First Balloon Ascent</h1>
                <p>Following his own account, Lunardi's first act on finding himself fairly above the town was to fortify
                    himself with some glasses of wine, and to devour the leg of a chicken. He describes the city as a vast 
                    beehive, St. Paul's and other churches standing out prominently; the streets shrunk to lines, and all 
                    humanity apparently transfixed and watching him. A little later he is equally struck with the view of 
                    the open country, and his ecstasy is pardonable in a novice. The verdant pastures eclipsed the visions 
                    of his own lands. The precision of boundaries impressed him with a sense of law and order, and of good 
                    administration in the country where he was a sojourner.
                </p>
                <p>By this time he found his balloon, which had been only two-thirds full at starting, to be so distended 
                    that he was obliged to untie the mouth to release the strain. He also found that the condensed moisture 
                    round the neck had frozen. These two statements point to his having reached a considerable altitude, 
                    which is intelligible enough. It is, however, difficult to believe his further assertion that by the use 
                    of his single oar he succeeded in working himself down to within a few hundred feet of the earth. The 
                    descent of the balloon must, in point of fact, have been due to a copious outrush of gas at his former 
                    altitude. Had his oar really been effective in working the balloon down it would not have needed the 
                    discharge of ballast presently spoken of to cause it to reascend. Anyhow, he found himself sufficiently 
                    near the earth to land a passenger who was anxious to get out. His cat had not been comfortable in the 
                    cold upper regions, and now at its urgent appeal was deposited in a corn field, which was the point of 
                    first contact with the earth. It was carefully received by a country-woman, who promptly sold it to a 
                    gentleman on the other side of the hedge, who had been pursuing the balloon.
