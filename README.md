In this repository I will include html and css files that I will be writing in order to get better with both of them.

I started by full-stack development journey with the Odin Project. I am not close to being done with it but I noticed several areas where I could improve on when doing the "Landing Page" project.

That being said, my main focus will be on writing efficient code, reducing redundancies, and having better organized code.

I am not sure how this repository will be structured, but here goes nothing.
